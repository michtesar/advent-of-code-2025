# Advent of Code 2025

My humble solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), this time in
TypeScript.

I am trying to resolve most of them as life long Pythonista learning TypeScript.
I also have a day job, family, friends and sleep schedule, so do not expect any
hardcore solutions. If it runs fine on my MacBook Air M3 should be just fine.

## How to run it?

In theory all you need is Deno 2 and run the script with
`deno --allow-read day-01/part1.ts`.

The codebase is organized into days and there is always part 1 and part 2.

Although, so far the puzzles input hasn't changed from part 1 and 2 I tend to
copy over them as I first write the program to solve the example one before
moving to the provided puzzle inputs.

## Summary

This is just for fun, please take it as is. If you find something, I would be
happy to hear about it, so feel free to file the GitHub issue for me. Thanks!
